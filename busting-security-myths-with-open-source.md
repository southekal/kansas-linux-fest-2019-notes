### title: busting open source security myths
### speaker: [eric hendricks](https://kansaslinuxfest.org/eric-the-it-guy/)
### date: 08102019

#### notes:
- waterfall is slow and prone to frustrations/not collaborative
- devops becoming the core of business
- openssl, apache, nginx are all heavily relied on
- 70-80% use open source but nearly 90% have vulnerabilities
- common issues talked about:
  - cant make sense of licenses; copy left: truly open source/ permissive
  - developed by amateurs
  - oss cant scale
  - no support
- get security to the fore-front of the conversation
- sonarcube/gitlab: run scans on codebase and libraries
